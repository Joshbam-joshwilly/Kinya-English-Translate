""
The purpose of this book is to assist the person learning Kinyarwanda.

""
"vocabulary used in the Cox Grammar and also that in the Gospel of Mark (1957 edition), plus"
other commonly used words.

A few notes on the orthography used:
1)
2 )
""
"imp- is used rather than imh- (as in impamba,impumyi, etc.)"
"Since ill. and f are sometimes used interchangeably, in looking for a word with this"
"sound, try under both spellings."
"The letter L has been used throughout, rather than L except in the case of a few words"
of foreign origin.
"You will note markings above some of the vowels, e.g. a, e, 1, O. This mark usually"
"indicates a high, lengthened tone, though in a few cases it is a low lengthened tone."
Many more low ones could have been indicated. No short tones are indicated. You will
"need to have a Munyarwanda help you with pronunciation, since Kinyarwanda is a tonal"
"language. These markings are not usually used in writing or printing the language, but"
are here to help you learn to pronounce the words correctly. Most long markings are
not included in the English-Kinyarwanda section.
""
"The authors are aware there will be imperfections and lacks, but hope that in spite of them"
""
this book will be of some use to those beginning their study of Kinyarwanda.
